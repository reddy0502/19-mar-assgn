    "Min-Max scaling is a type of data scaling method used in data preprocessing to transform the range of features to a fixed range of values between 0 and 1. This method linearly scales the values in the feature to a new range by subtracting the minimum value from the feature and then dividing the result by the range of the feature (i.e., the difference between the maximum and minimum values).\n",
    "\n",
    "Min-Max scaling is useful when the features have different scales or ranges, and the values of the features need to be compared or used by a model that requires standardized input. This method preserves the relationship between the values of the features and is useful for some machine learning algorithms that require the input features to be in a specific range.\n",

    "For example, suppose you have a dataset that contains the height and weight of a group of people, and you want to use this data to train a machine learning model to predict whether a person is obese based on their height and weight. The height values range from 120 to 200 cm, and the weight values range from 40 to 120 kg. To apply Min-Max scaling to these features, you would first calculate the minimum and maximum values of each feature."
